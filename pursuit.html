									<h3 class="major">About the game</h3>
									<p>In the near future, a ‘lucid dream’ device DreamReal is invented and commercialized. DreamReal is unique in that it helps users to be concious in their dreams, effectively giving them total control in what they do in the dream world. The only drawback is that it cannot create a dream of your choice in the first place, since the dream world is generated from personal experience.</p>
									<p>DreamReal quickly become popular all over the world, for whoever can resist the temptation of dream escapice? Akira is no exception. Being a high school student, he usually gets bored of his real life and turns to DreamReal, seeing it as his perfect alternate reality.</p>
									<p>In the town of Remembrance, a small place in one corner of the world, strange incidents start to happen: a few users of DreamReal completely lose their memories after waking up, a phenomenon never recorded before. An even stranger thing is that no one seems to remember the victims, like they never even exist! Akira has been wondering about this; he remembers the victims, but later disregard it as mere imaginations. Taking no heeds of the incidents, Akira continue to enjoy his dream marvel. One day, Akira enters the dream world with DreamReal only to find himself trapped in a strange building. This has never happened before, as he had always been in a completely open and free dream world. What’s worse, he continuously enters that building in the following days, staying in the same place with almost no way out. What on earth is happening?</p>
									<p>Playing as Akira, you will have to find your way around and escape this maze, only to discover even more nightmares behind each and every door.</p>

									<p>Key features:</p>
									<ul>
										<li><b>Challenging real-time battle system.</b> Death comes with a cost.</li>
										<li><b>Out-of-the-box puzzles</b> to solve.</li>
										<li><b>Story-driven interaction</b> with other characters to learn more about their stories</li>
